Introduction
============

Here's the blog post that started it all:

Installation
============

Find your Arduino IDE's libraries directory. Then unzip the project
archive into it. It should end up looking like this:

[Your Arduino documents directory]/
  libraries/
    G35Arduino/
      G35.h (etc.)

Then restart your Arduino IDE and you should see G35Arduino among
the libraries.

If you think you might contribute improvements back to the project,
git clone into libraries/ instead of unzipping. We look forward to
your pull requests!
